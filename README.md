* **I wrote this python script in order to solve a <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/124?category=1&page=1" target="_blank"><er>PicoCTF challenge</er></a>.**
* **It is Web Exploitation challenge worth 90 points, however it's a lot more harder that the given point value.**
* **It is about performing a ```CBC Bit Flipping``` attack against an ```homomorphic encryption``` in order to find the bit responsible of identifying admin users from normal users, flip that bit and gain access as admin to eventually get the flag.**

* **This python script perform a Brute-Force attack by iterating over every byte and flipping every single bit until the flag is shown.**
* **For more informations about the challenge or the script, check out my blog <a href="https://younestasra-r4z3rsw0rd.github.io/posts/MoreCookies/" target="_blank"><er>here</er></a>**
